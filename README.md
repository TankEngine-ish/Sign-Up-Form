# Sign-Up-Form
This is another html/css project which focuses on making 
a mock-up of a registration form.

In this project I utilized Sass for the first time although
it wasn't quite needed as this was a very simple project.

I've decided to create a faux online platform for booking
doctor appointments. It's not doing any backend validations but
soon enough I'll be able to make such services fully responsible.
